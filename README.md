# **Understanding the Security Landscape of Pre-trained Encoders: A Comprehensive Survey**

A **continual** collection of papers related to Attacks and Defenses in the pre-training scenario.

Pre-trained encoders have drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its superior performance on numerous downstream tasks after fine-tuning.
Despite their remarkable capabilities, the increased complexity and deployment of  pre-trained encoders have also exposed them to various security threats and vulnerabilities, making the study of attacks on these models a critical area of research.

Here, we've summarized existing  attacks methods in our survey paperüëç.
